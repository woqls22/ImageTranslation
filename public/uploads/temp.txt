Tesseract at UB Mannheim

The Mannheim University Library (UB Mannheim) uses Tesseract to perform OCR (optical character
recognition) of historical German newspapers (Allgemeine PreuBische Staatszeitung, Deutscher
Reichsanzeiger). The latest results with OCR from more than 360,000 scans are available online.

Normally we run Tesseract on Debian GNU Linux, but there was also the need for a Windows version
That's why we have built a Tesseract installer for Windows.

WARNING: Tesseract should be either installed in the directory which is suggested during the
installation or in a new directory. The uninstaller removes the whole installation directory. If you
installed Tesseract in an existing directory, that directory will be removed with all its
subdirectories and files.

The latest installers can be downloaded here:
